Description:  This example reduces a polycrystal dump file to one that only includes the atoms at the interfaces.

Prerequisites:  combat.py, NumPy, SciPy

Input files:  Requires a LAMMPS dump file (dump.polycrystal) containing the polycrystalline sample structure

Usage:  python identifyGB.py

Output:  Creates a dump file called dump.boundaries that contains the atomic coordinates 
	 of the interface atoms in a polycrystalline sample.

Contributing Author:  Michael Fortunato and James Larentzos

Notes:  See Example A2 and A5 in the appendix of ARL Technical Report ARL-TR-8213, 2017.
	Example A5 generates the polycrystal dump file and Example A5 reduces it to only the interface atoms.
