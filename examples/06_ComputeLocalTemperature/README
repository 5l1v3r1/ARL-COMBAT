Description:  This example computes the local temperature and outputs it to a modified dump file.

Prerequisites:  combat.py, NumPy, SciPy

Input files:  Requires a LAMMPS dump file (dump.singlecrystal) containing a single crystal sample

Usage:  python addLocalTemperature.py

Output:  Creates a dump file called dump.weighting that contains the atomic coordinates, as well as
	 an additional column containing the locally weighted property.

Contributing Author:  Michael Fortunato and James Larentzos

Notes:  See Example A1 and A6 in the appendix of ARL Technical Report ARL-TR-8213, 2017.
	Example A1 generates the single crystal dump file and Example A6 computes/dumps the locally averaged property.
